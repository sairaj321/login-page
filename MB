In Bootstrap, mb-3 is a utility class for margin-bottom with a value of 1rem (16px by default).

Breakdown of mb-3:
m: Refers to margin. Bootstrap provides separate classes for:

m (margin on all sides)
mt (margin-top)
mr (margin-right)
mb (margin-bottom)
ml (margin-left)
mx (horizontal margins: left and right)
my (vertical margins: top and bottom)
b: Specifies the side, in this case, bottom.

3: Defines the size of the margin using Bootstrap's spacing scale. The scale ranges from 0 to 5, where:

0: No margin
1: 0.25rem (4px)
2: 0.5rem (8px)
3: 1rem (16px)
4: 1.5rem (24px)
5: 3rem (48px)
Example:
html
Copy code
<div class="mb-3">
  This div has a bottom margin of 1rem (16px).
</div>
In this case, the element gets a bottom margin, creating space between it and the next element.

Why Use It?
Consistency: Ensures consistent spacing across elements without manually defining CSS.
Flexibility: Quickly adjust spacing by changing the class (e.g., mb-4 for a larger margin).
Responsive Design: Bootstrap allows using responsive breakpoints, like mb-md-3 (applies mb-3 for medium screens and larger).
Responsive Variants:
You can use responsive classes to control margins for different screen sizes:

mb-sm-3: Applies mb-3 for small screens and larger.
mb-lg-3: Applies mb-3 for large screens and larger.
Example:

html
Copy code
<div class="mb-3 mb-lg-5">
  This div has `mb-3` on small screens but `mb-5` on large screens and above.
</div>
